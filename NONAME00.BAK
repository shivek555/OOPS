I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
… I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please carry me, carry me, carry me home
… I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game\n
… Oh\n
Oh\n
All I know, all I know\n
Loving you is a losing game\n
… Do you love me, love me not?\n
Giving pieces from my heart\n
Tomorrow's coming and has gone\n
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on\n
… Oh\n
Oh\n
All I know, all I know\n
Loving you is a losing game\n
… Oh\n
Oh\n
All I know, all I know\n
Loving you is a losing game\n
… I don't need your games, game over\n
… Get me off this rollercoaster\n
… Oh\n
Oh\n
All I know, all I know\n
Loving you is a losing game\n
… Oh\n
Oh\n
All I know, all I know\n
Loving you is a losing game"
